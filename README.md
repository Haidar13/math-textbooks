## Online Mathematics Textbooks

> *editor's note* this list was [originally authored](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~cain/textbooks/onlinebooks.html) by George Cain of Georgia Tech and is offered here on github so it might be preserved/maintained after his passing in 2015.  

(If GA Tech prefers that their page be preserved and the canonical reference I can take this repo down).

The writing of textbooks and making them freely available on the web is an idea whose time has arrived. Most college mathematics textbooks attempt to be all things to all people and, as a result, are much too big and expensive. This perhaps made some sense when these books were rather expensive to produce and distribute--but this time has passed.

1.  Professor [Jim Herod](http://www.math.gatech.edu/~herod) and I have written [_Multivariable Calculus_](../notes/calculus.html) ,a book which we and a few others have used here at Georgia Tech for two years. We have also proposed that this be the first calculus course in the curriculum here, but that is another story....

2.  Although it is still in print, [_Calculus_](http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/textbooks/Strang/strangtext.htm),by [Gilbert Strang](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/) is made available through [MIT's OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html) electronic publishing initiative.

3.  Here is one that has also been used here at Georgia Tech. [_Linear Methods of Applied Mathematics_](http://www.mathphysics.com/pde/), by [Evans Harrell](http://www.math.gatech.edu/~harrell) and [James Herod](http://www.math.gatech.edu/~herod).

4.  Yet another one produced at Georgia Tech is [_Linear Algebra, Infinite Dimensions, and Maple_](http://www.math.gatech.edu/~herod/Hspace/Hspace.html), by [James Herod](http://www.math.gatech.edu/~herod).

5.  George Cain has also written a modest book, [_Complex Analysis_](../winter99/complex.html), which he has used in his introductory undergraduate complex analysis course at GA Tech.
